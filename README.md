# bitcraft-map-pathfinder

Script that draws a path from point A to point B using map image and recognizing different colors as terrain 
takes into account cost of "swapping zone" from land to ocean and back (need to tweak weights)
TODO: add some sorta user friendly ui or command prompt
TODO: encode all biomes with weights
TODO: choose specifict vehicles to use
TODO: write path stats to file to accompany the image (or draw them on the image?)
